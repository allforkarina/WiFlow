# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `dataloader.py`: Core module for loading NPY memmap datasets, creating PyTorch `DataLoader` instances with `memmap_collate_fn`, and providing `create_memmap_data_loader` / `create_memmap_data_loaders` factory functions.
- `data/memmap_dataset.py`: NPY memmap dataset reader that loads CSI amplitude, OpenPose18 keypoints, and metadata from `.npy`/`.npz` files with zero-copy OS-cached I/O.
- `data/heatmap_gt.py`: Functions for generating OpenPose18 PCM/PAF targets from normalized keypoint coordinates.
- `pose_targets.py`: Torch utilities for online OpenPose18 PCM/PAF target synthesis from normalized coordinates and argmax PCM decoding back to normalized keypoints.
- `models/`: PyTorch model code, including the full WiFlow model, CSI spatial encoder with symmetric spatio-temporal downsampling, axial attention encoder, spatial-temporal fuser (legacy), multi-layer joint cross-attention decoder, hierarchical joint decoder ablation, MultiFormer-style MSFN heatmap decoder with PAPM feedback, legacy temporal encoder, legacy attention pooler, legacy skeleton-aware decoder, and shared OpenPose18 skeleton topology. The active single-frame model path is CSI amplitude input -> spatial encoder with antenna mixing, feature stem, and symmetric time-frequency residual blocks -> axial encoder -> the configured decoder.
- `train.py`: Root-level training entrypoint for WiFlow pose regression, including losses, metrics, optimizer, scheduler, checkpointing, and CSV logging.
- `eval.py`: Root-level evaluation entrypoint for loading checkpoints, computing test metrics, and saving CSI/skeleton visualizations.
- `scripts/build_memmap.py`: Command-line wrapper that builds an NPY memmap dataset from the raw MM-Fi directory structure.
- `tests/`: `pytest` unit tests. Mirror module names such as `tests/test_dataloader.py`, `tests/test_wiflow_model.py`, or `tests/test_wiflow_decoder.py`.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes Python caches, local environments, generated datasets, checkpoints, and editor files from Git.

Generated datasets can be large and should not be committed. Keep raw dataset roots outside the repository.

## Project Domain Knowledge
- One CSI sample is a physical signal tensor shaped `64 time steps x 3 antennas x 114 subcarriers` in the NPY memmap dataset. The model input is `[B, 3, 114, 64]` (channels-first). The subcarrier axis carries spatial-frequency response, the antenna axis carries spatial phase-difference and direction information, and the temporal axis (64 steps, upsampled from 10 original time shots) carries motion cues such as Doppler effects.
- Only CSI amplitude is used as input (3 channels, one per antenna). Phase information is not used.
- The target pose is the structured OpenPose18 keypoint set (18 joints including neck). The 18 joints are not independent coordinates; they are constrained by the human skeleton topology (19 bone edges).
- The central modeling gap is that CSI is a low-resolution, high-noise, implicit sensing signal, while pose regression needs precise coordinates. Strong skeleton priors are important for bridging that gap.
- Preserve CSI physical dimension semantics where practical. Avoid arbitrary flattening or pooling that mixes antenna, subcarrier, and temporal meanings before the model has selected useful information.
- Prefer attention-based information selection over destructive pooling for low-SNR CSI features, and use structured supervision such as bone or topology-aware losses in addition to coordinate losses.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the existing Conda environment for development commands:

```powershell
conda activate WiFiPose
pip install numpy scipy h5py tqdm torch pytest
```

Build an NPY memmap dataset:

```powershell
python scripts\build_memmap.py --dataset-root D:\path\to\raw\dataset --output-dir data\mmfi_pose --seed 42
```

Run tests:

```powershell
pytest
```

Run a quick training sanity check:

```powershell
python train.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --epochs 5 --subset-size 32 --output-dir outputs\sanity
```

Run the default training configuration:

```powershell
python train.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --epochs 50 --batch-size 64 --output-dir outputs\train
```

The default training configuration uses CSI amplitude input (3 channels), `OneCycleLR`, gradient clipping, `coord_l1 + 0.5 * bone_l1`, the baseline axial mode `spatial_then_temporal`, and AdamW weight decay.

Run an axial-attention encoder ablation:

```powershell
python train.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --axial-mode temporal_then_spatial --epochs 50 --batch-size 64 --output-dir outputs\train_temporal_then_spatial
```

Run a hierarchical decoder ablation:

```powershell
python train.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --decoder-type hierarchical --epochs 50 --batch-size 64 --output-dir outputs\train_hierarchical_decoder
```

Run a MultiFormer-style MSFN heatmap decoder ablation:

```powershell
python train.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --decoder-type heatmap_msfn --epochs 50 --batch-size 64 --output-dir outputs\train_heatmap_msfn
```

The `heatmap_msfn` decoder uses OpenPose18 labels, synthesizes PCM/PAF targets online from normalized coordinates, trains with multi-stage PCM/PAF MSE, and decodes the last-stage PCM by argmax for MPJPE/PCK. It exposes `--heatmap-size`, `--heatmap-sigma`, `--paf-width`, and `--paf-loss-weight`; default MSFN internals use 3 stages, 128 heatmap feature channels, 512 decoder hidden channels, and PAPM feedback from concatenated PCM/PAF.

Supported `--axial-mode` values are `spatial_then_temporal`, `temporal_then_spatial`, `parallel_sum`, and `parallel_concat`. Supported `--decoder-type` values are `joint`, `hierarchical`, and `heatmap_msfn`. Checkpoints store the selected mode, decoder type, and heatmap settings in `train_config`, and evaluation rebuilds the model from that saved configuration.

Evaluate one checkpoint:

```powershell
python eval.py --dataset-root data\mmfi_pose --checkpoint outputs\train\best_val_mpjpe.pth --output-dir outputs\eval
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use Python 3.10+ syntax, type hints, and `pathlib.Path` for paths. Group imports as standard library, third-party, then local. Follow existing naming: `snake_case` functions/variables, `PascalCase` classes, and uppercase constants such as `NUM_OPENPOSE_KEYPOINTS`. Use 4-space indentation. Keep comments focused on dataset assumptions, shapes, and normalization.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated tests use `pytest`. Add tests for split generation, path validation, shape validation, normalization edge cases, model shape contracts, PCM/PAF target synthesis, heatmap decoder stage outputs, and memmap dataset loading. Name files `test_*.py` and tests `test_<behavior>()`. Use temporary directories and tiny synthetic fixtures.

Training and evaluation outputs are written under `outputs/` by default. Checkpoints include `best_val_mpjpe.pth`, `best_val_pck_0_2.pth`, and `last.pth`; epoch metrics are appended to `train_log.csv`. Evaluation visualizations are saved as `.png` files grouped by action/environment samples.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
This checkout has no `.git` history, so no convention can be inferred. Use concise imperative commits, for example `Add NPY memmap dataset support`. Pull requests should include a summary, commands run, dataset assumptions, and relevant shape or frame-count output. Do not commit generated datasets, virtual environments, or machine-specific paths.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not hard-code private dataset locations beyond documented defaults. Pass dataset paths with `--dataset-root` and keep large or sensitive data outside version control.

## Agent-Specific Instructions
Write repository-facing agent notes, documentation, and code comments in English. Keep comments neatly aligned with surrounding style. Use Chinese for conversational replies unless the user requests another language.

Whenever project code changes, update this `AGENTS.md` file in the same turn if the change affects commands, structure, conventions, testing, configuration, or agent workflow.

After each project modification, commit the change and push it to the configured GitHub remote in the same turn unless the user explicitly asks not to push.

Before changing code, apply the `karpathy-guidelines` skill: state assumptions when needed, prefer the smallest working change, avoid unrelated refactors, and verify the result with a concrete check.

Before running project code or tests, activate the existing Conda environment with `conda activate WiFiPose` to ensure commands run in the established project environment.
